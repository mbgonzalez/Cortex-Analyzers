# Cortex Analyzers

These are Cortex analyzers for TheHive, they are working in thehive4. Things to consider:
- Put the directory with the name of the analyzer in your analyzers directory, could be the default or another custom.
- Inside the directory "thehive-templates" are the templates to make it look good.
